            <h2>Vaporwave...</h2>
            <p> ...is a microgenre of electronic music, a visual art style, and an Internet meme that emerged in the
                early
                2010s. It is defined partly by its slowed-down, chopped and screwed samples of smooth jazz,
                elevator, R&B, and lounge music from the 1980s and 1990s. The surrounding subculture is sometimes
                associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and pop culture, and tends to be
                characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and
                advertising of previous decades. Visually, it incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web
                design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music
                videos. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave">Wikipedia</a></p>
            <p>On display at the West Wing Gallery are three very prominent albums of the genre.</p>

            <h3>Floral Shoppe</h3>
            <p>Featuring eerie slowed-down vocals, glitchy time signatures and ambient soundscapes, Floral Shoppe is
                often considered the defining album of the vaporwave genre. Produced by Portland artist Ramona Xavier
                (Vektroid) under the pseudonym Macintosh Plus, the album‚Äôs sample sources include smooth jazz, 1980s
                R&B, new age music and the soundtrack to the Nintendo 64 game Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. The album's second
                track, "„É™„Çµ„Éï„É©„É≥„ÇØ420 / Áèæ‰ª£„ÅÆ„Ç≥„É≥„Éî„É•„Éº" (Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing), has become nearly synonymous with the
                term "vaporwave" within popular discourse. The song had over 40.5 million views on YouTube before being
                taken down on April 27, 2018 (due to copyright claims by Sony Music) and has spawned many covers. Listen

            <h3>Blank Banshee 0</h3>
            <p>By combining traditional elements of the vaporwave genre with trap music, a style which has since gone on
                to be dubbed as ‚Äúvaportrap‚Äù, Blank Banshee‚Äôs music sounds completely unique and other-worldly. The album
                consists of largely 1980s and 1990s sourced samples layered over original beats, instrumentation and
                vocals. Many tracks blend trap style beats with elements previously associated with genres like seapunk
                and vaporwave, such
                as OS start-up sounds and 1990s era video game music. Blank Banshee 0's style and influence have been
                attributed to a shift in the direction of vaporwave. The eleventh song on the album, 'Teen Pregancy',
                became part of a viral video trend in 2016 called "Simpsonwave". Listen

            <h3>Mana Pool</h3>
            <p>Mana Pool is a watery, computer-inspired instrumental vaporwave and trap record. At 22 minutes, the
                album flows gently with smooth synth pads and leads but hits hard where it counts ‚Äì the percussion and
                bass. Featuring lush liquid-esque soundscapes, icy trap beats and 808 basses, the album‚Äôs production may
                be considered quite minimalist but it is, however, also extremely atmospheric. It has since gone on to
                become a much-loved classic within the vaporwave community. Listen on <a
